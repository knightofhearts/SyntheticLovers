Mizu here! Using the repo is super easy, but it can get a little confusing. Here's how it works:
Anything you put in the folder associated with the repo can be added to the main folder of the game. 
Start by making a github account: 
https://github.com/
After, either me or Irlana can add you to the repo.
I suggest downloading github desktop: https://desktop.github.com
But you can do it through your browser.
