Mizu here! Using the repo is super easy, but it can get a little confusing. Here's how it works:
Anything you put in the folder associated with the repo can be added to the main folder of the game. 
Start by making a github account: 
https://github.com/

After, either me or Irlana can add you to the repo.
I suggest downloading github desktop: https://desktop.github.com

But you can do it through your browser. On brower, you will constantly have to re-download files you want to change like 
script/code. If you have github desktop, whenever you make any changes to the folder, you can upload it to the repo. You can 
also PULL, which will change all the files to the most current copy.

ON BROWSER:
Simply click on upload file and add your stuff where ever you want on the repo. 

ON DESKTOP:
You need to COMMIT your changes, and then PUSH them. (You'll have to PULL to get the latest update before commiting/pushing.)
Think of COMMITING as getting engaged and PUSHING as having the wedding. Comitting will save your changes, but won't
make it official. Pushing makes it totally offical and everyone will have it. 

If you have any more questions, ask me!
